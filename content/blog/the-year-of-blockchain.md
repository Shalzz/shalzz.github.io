The year of 2019 has been a wild ride for the blockchain industry.
The looming ban on cryptocurrencies by the Indian government and the leak of a
draft bill that proposes a 10 year jail term.
The long awaited end of crypto winter with bitcoin reaching a high of $13,000 and
hovering around $10,000 as of this writing.
The announcement of a "cryptocurrency"
by Facebook and their plans to make it a global stable digital coin.

These all might seem like unrelated events but they all point to one thing,
the blockchain and cryptocurrencies ecosystem has reached a level of maturity
that big tech companies and democratic governments around the world are not only
taking notice but are taking proactive steps to adopt and regulate the industry.

Andreas M. Antonopoulos lists out [three elements][1] to success in this industry:
Market, Timing and Sequencing.

  * *Market*: At this point we can all agree there is a market for cryptocurrencies
	and gaps in the financial technologies that bitcoin and others fill.

  * *Timing*: After the 2008 stock market crash and the Nov 2016 demonetisation by the
	Indian government, people are seeing the frailty of the traditional
	financial systems and their faith that their money is safe is diminishing.

  * *Sequencing/Prerequisites*: Andreas describes this as the density of adoption
 of the underlying technology. In the case of internet, layer 2 solutions like
Facebook and Google where possible only because email drove the adoption of the
internet to the point where every had to have email for work. This insured there
was enough users already on the internet, the infrastructure was already laid out
and people had the technical skills to get on the internet.

### Currency is the email of blockchain

Here I'll try and describe how the current circumstances will help accelerate the
adoption of the blockchain technologies
 
First, the Indian governments proposed [draft bill][3] blanket banning the
use and holding of cryptocurrencies of any kind.
This might seem to be disengaging for the use and spread of cryptocurrency within
the Indian economy but unlike the ban by china after which much of the draft bill
is modeled after, the Indian government does not have neither the judicial right
to block any <abbr title="peer to peer">p2p</abbr> network traffic nor the technical 
infrastructure to implement anything similar to the Great Firewall of China.
Rather the unintended effect of the proposal and approval of this bill will be
 [Streisand effect][2]. Where the fact that the government is going out of their
way to block and ban a neural technology. Disallowing it's use to the people will
spark interest and widespread awareness about this topic and what probable cause
or justification the government might have to ban such a technology.

The bill will take away any last hope of businesses and startups working
on anything even close to cryptocurrencies and blockchains in India and in the process
lose any strategic and technological superiority against other countries.

But the government with its limited resources and knowledge about the blockchain
technology and its use cases will not be able to prevent the p2p and decentralized use
of the technology, which is precisely the features and use case that bitcoin and
others aim to provide. Albeit many business will not be to accept bitcoin upfront
and do not do so anyways do to its currently limited transactional throughput
capabilities, people will not cease to buy and invest in what they will see as 
an excellent store of value akin to digital gold and few will even continue to
trade.

The government in its draft bill has effectively proposed a ban on the flow and
storing of information where anyone holding 12 words on a piece of paper representing
their digital wallets private keys will be prosecuted and sentenced to a possible
of 10 years in jail. This is nothing short of a surveillance state trying their
best to siphon and hold onto any control and power they can, withstanding
the title of the worlds largest democracy.

Second, the announcement and launch of libra. The aol of money/cryptocurrencies.
introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies, main driver of adoption.
Too big to ban. creates enough grey area. Not exactly blockchain but enough to fools
regulators and governments. Comply with traditional laws on the surface but create
enough cracks for people to slip though into the system.

Third, more performant and scalable blockchains to support the influx of more users
and adoption as well as driving the development, discovery and use of 2nd layer
blockchain solutions that bring the open and decentralized nature to different usecases.
